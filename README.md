•        Check the validity of the analytical solution within the defined constraints.	 
 	 
5. Numerical Solution (if necessary)	 
•        If the analytical solution is not feasible, develop a numerical solution.	 
 	 
•        Use numerical methods (e.g., finite element method, numerical integration).	 
 	 
6. Simulation and Validation	 
•        Implement the model in simulation software (e.g., MATLAB, Simulink).	 
 	 
•        Validate the results with experimental data or known benchmarks.	 
 	 
7. Optimization (if applicable)

Example Calculation: Load Flow Analysis in Power Systems	 
Here's a simplified example of a calculation formulation for load flow analysis in power systems:	 
 	 
Step 1: Define the Problem	 
•        Objective: Determine the voltage and phase angle at each bus in the power system.	 
 	 
•        Variables: Bus voltages (V), phase angles (θ), real power (P), reactive power (Q).	 
 	 
•        Constraints: Power balance equations, voltage limits.	 
 	 
Step 2: Develop the Mathematical Model	 
•        Use the power flow equations: $$P_i = V_i \sum_{j=1}^{n} V_j (G_{ij} \cos \theta_{ij} + B_{ij} \sin \theta_{ij})$$ $$Q_i = V_i \sum_{j=1}^{n} V_j (G_{ij} \sin \theta_{ij} - B_{ij} \cos \theta_{ij})$$ Where GijG_{ij} and BijB_{ij} are the conductance and susceptance of the transmission line between buses ii and jj.
 	 
Step 3: Simplify the Equations	 
•        Apply any necessary assumptions (e.g., flat start method with initial voltage guesses).	 
 	 
Step 4: Analytical Solution	 
•        Not feasible for large power systems.	 
 	 
Step 5: Numerical Solution	 
•        Use the Newton-Raphson method to solve the power flow equations iteratively.	 
 	 
Step 6: Simulation and Validation	 
•        Implement the Newton-Raphson method in MATLAB.	 
 	 
•        Validate the results with a test power system.	 
 	 
Step 7: Optimization	 
•        Optimize the power flow to minimize losses or improve voltage stability.	 
 	 
By following these steps, you can create a robust and accurate calculation formulation for various electrical engineering problems. If you need help with a specific calculation or further details on any step, feel free to ask!

Web-Based Crime Management System for Samara City Main Police Station 
Demelash Lemmi Ettisa1, Minota Milkias2 
Abstract 
Crime is a human experience, and it must be controlled. The Samara town police station plays a signifi 
cant role in controlling crime. However, the management of crime activities is done manually, which is 
due to the lack of an automated system that supports the station workers in communicating with citize 
ns to share information and store, retrieve, and manage crime activities. To control crime efficiently 
, we need to develop online crime management systems. 
This project, entitled "Web-Based Crime Management System," is designed to develop an online applicati 
on in which any citizen can report crimes; if anybody wants to file a complaint against crimes, they m 
ust enjoy online communication with the police. This project provides records of crimes that have led UserForm17 - 4 
to disciplinary cases in addition to being used to simply retrieve information from the database. The 
system implemented is a typical web-based crime record management system based on client-server archit 
ecture, allowing data storage and crime record interchange with police stations.

Chapter One 
1. Introduction to the Study 
The "Crime Management System" is a web-based website for online complaining and computerized managemen 
t of crime records (Khan et al., 2008). 
A criminal is a popular term used for a person who has committed a crime or has been legally convicted 
of a crime. "Criminal" also means being connected with a crime. When certain acts or people are invol 
ved in or related to a crime, they are termed as criminal (Wex, 2023). 
Samara City 's main police station is located in Samara City, within the Afar Regional State. It was e 
stablished in 1984 E.C. with the purpose of protecting local communities from criminal activities. The 
Samara City police station is situated near the diesel suppliers in Samara City. In the first phase, 
there was a small number of police members, including commanders, inspectors, and constables. But rece 
ntly, more than 170 police members have been employed. It is a well-organized police station that serv 
es in crime prevention; the detection and conviction of criminals depend on a highly responsive manner 
. The effectiveness of this station is based on how efficient, reliable, and fast it is. As a conseque 
nce, the station maintains a large volume of information. To manage their information requirements, th 
e station is currently using an information system. This system is manual and paper-based, where infor 
mation is passed hand-to-hand, and information is kept in hard-copy paper files stored ordinarily in f 
ili 
g cabinets. Despite the relevance of their information system, it poses several challenges in the mana 
gement of information, including an ever-increasing paper load, difficulty in enforcing file access co 
ntrols, and cases of missing files and information. 
To have a peaceful life, we need a well-organized law enforcement system. In our city, Samara, we have 
very good facilities in the law enforcement sector. However, due to a lack of facilities, some work c 
annot be done in a very good way. The widely employed CMS method in Samara City is the manual process. 
This approach entails the use of paper files in the documentation of criminal information. For this r 
eason, a website will be produced for the Crime Management System. The main authority is given to the 
administrator. Next is the main module of the system, which is the crime module. In this way, all the 
crime information will be stored in the database. First, complaint details will be added to the system 
, and then station employees will check if the complaint is related to a crime or law and order. The r 
esearcher focuses on a crime management system to provide services based on a computerized or web-base 
d system for the main police station in Samara. It also emphasizes computerized work on many activitie 
s, 
especially recording and reporting crime information. The researcher will help to facilitate an easy c 
rime management system by making it reliable and efficient by implementing the loss of many crime work 
s means web-based through the crime parts of the Samara City main police station. 
The aim of the proposed system is to develop a system with improved facilities. The proposed system ca 
n overcome all the limitations of the existing system. The system provides proper security and reduces 
manual work. 
Security of data. 
Minimize manual data entry. 
Better service. 
User-friendly and interactive. 
Minimum time required. 
Changing the manual system into an automated system. 
1.1. Statement of the Problem 
The police station record management system is a project designed with the aim of maintaining all the 
records and details related to a police station in order to increase efficiency. As a result of making 
it easier to manage and administer a police station, this record management system makes the manageme 
nt and administration of a police station easier and more effective. Every country has always placed t 
he safety and protection of human rights at the top of its priorities, since without them no country c 
an exist. It is the responsibility of every country's government to protect the freedom and rights of 
all human beings without discrimination so that every individual can lead his life with his own choice 
without violating the rules and regulations set by the government of that country (Fluchtplan erstell 
en, 2023). 
The existing system of the Samara Police Station crime record management is a manual system. With the 
existing system, all activities are performed manually; there is no computerized system like a databas 
e or website. Files are manually stored, moved, and processed from one section to another. Reports are 
manually prepared and delivered to the appropriate unit. In the existing system, it's very difficult 
to retrieve any record information because different records are written in paper-based books or agendUserForm17 - 5 
as. The problems in the existing system are: 
Limitations on crime recording: Recording crime information manually. 
Limitation on System Retrievals: The information is very difficult to retrieve, and finding partic 
ular information, like searching for crime detail information, is challenging. 
Problem with information storage: The information generated by various transactions takes time and 
effort to be stored in the right place. 
Problems with updating records: Various changes to information, like crime details, are difficult 
to update. 
More manpower required: Many police officers are needed to handle crime. 
Time-consuming: It is time-consuming to record crime. 
Consumes a large volume of paperwork: it requires much paper to record a crime file. 
Lack of security and space: There is no security for data because it is paper-based and has no pas 
sword. 
Report generation latency: There is an overlap of crime records from others. 
Poor inter-station sharing and connectivity. 
Therefore, the main objective of this project was to solve the entire above-mentioned problem by devel 
oping a web-based crime management system for the Samara city police station. 
1.2. Objective 
1.2.1. General Objective 
The general objective of the project is to develop a web based crime management system for samara city 
main police station. 
1.2.2. Specific Objectives 
The specific objectives for our project are: 
Make a plan for how to carry out our project accordingly. 
Gather or collect data. 
Analyze the gathered data. 
Design the system based on the specified requirements. 
Develop an interactive user interface. 
Identify the functional and non-functional requirements. 
Implement the system based on the system design. 
Test to check the availability of the project. 
Finally, deploy the system in the working environment. 
1.3. Significance of the System 
The significance of this project will be: 
Providing a web-based crime reporting system for police stations. 
Reducing errors by suggesting appropriate actions for the recorded personal data. 
Giving efficient service within the time limit. 
Effective manipulation in terms of cost. 
Ease of use, updating, and maintenance. 
Facilitating the accessibility of information. 
1.4. Data gathering 
To gather accurate data from the concerned body, the researcher used the following fact-finding techni 
ques: 
Interview: In order to gather complete and appropriate information for the proposed project, the t 
eam selected a person to interview about the organization, consisting of inspectors and secretaries, t 
o get necessary information that is stated in the background of the project, like the existing problem 
s and costs, such as salary. 
Document Analysis: To get historical information about the organization's activities and to know t 
he organization's rules and regulations, the team tried to analyze as many documents as possible that 
were relevant to the new system. 
Observation: To get first-hand, accurate information about how the existing system works, the team 
observed the current system directly and found the pros and cons of the present system. 
1.5. Design Methodology 
The team decided to use object-oriented methodology (a system development approach that allows the reu 
se of existing components) for the following reasons: 
It is known to the group members. 
It is easier to maintain. 
There is ease of understanding object-oriented models due to a consistent underlying representatio 
n throughout the development process.UserForm17 - 6 
There is ease of modification and extensibility of object-oriented models. 
There is no separation between data and processes, unlike in structured analysis methodology, whic 
h treats data and processes separately. 
From the development method, we would use prototyping, and from the testing method, we would use i 
ntegration and system testing.

1.5.1. Analysis Methodology 
The analysis approach used is object-oriented analysis (OOA). This method was selected because "object 
-oriented analysis is a method of analysis that examines requirements from the perspectives of the cla 
sses and objects found in the vocabulary of the problem domain." The primary tasks in object-oriented 
analysis (OOA) are identifying objects, organizing the objects by creating an object-oriented model di 
agram, and defining the behavior of the objects. Here, common models used in OOA are use cases and obj 
ect models. 
The team looked at the problem domain with the aim of producing a conceptual model of the information 
that exists in the area that will be analyzed. The team selected users who use the system and tried to 
refine how the users communicate with each other. This model includes the functions of the system (us 
e case modeling), identifies the business objects, organizes the objects, and also the relationships b 
etween them, and finally models the behavior of the objects.

1.5.2. Hardware and Software to Be Used for Implementation 
The software requirements specification is the single most important document in the software developm 
ent process. The following are software requirements: 
XAMPP Server, MySQL, Editor, Edraw Max and Microsoft Office Visio, Browser, Microsoft Office Word 
2010, Microsoft PowerPoint 2010. 
Hardware requirements are the tangible and visible components that are necessary to develop a system. 
Hardware Tools that were used to develop this project are: 
Computers, Flash Disk (8GB), Pen and Paper, Mobile, Camera, Hard Disk.

2. System Modeling 
System modeling is the process of developing abstract models of a system, with each model presenting a 
different view or perspective of that system. It is about representing a system using some kind of gr 
aphical notation, which is now almost always based on notations in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) 
. Models help the analyst to understand the functionality of the system and are used to communicate wi 
th customers. 
2.1. Use Case Identification 
A use case describes the functionality that a system is supposed to perform or shows by modeling. Each 
use case describes a possible scenario of how the external entity interacts with the system. That mea 
ns it interacts with the entire system for external users. In modeling use cases, each use case descri 
bes the interaction between the actors within the system boundary. A Use Case describes the sequence o 
f actions that provides a measurable value to an actor, is drawn as a horizontal ellipse, and contains 
the use case name inside the ellipse. 
In the following table, we attempt to list the use case ID, the use case name, and its description.

2.2. Use Case Diagram 
A UML use case diagram shows the relationships among actors and use cases within a system. A use-case 
diagram is a graphic representation of the interactions among the elements of a system. Use case diagr 
ams show the various activities the users can perform on the system. The system is something that perf 
orms a function. They model the dynamic aspects of the system. It deals with who uses your application 
or system and what they can do with it 
A use case diagram contains the following sub-components: 
System boundary: which defines the system of interest in relation to the world around it. 
Actors: An actor is an entity that initiates the use case from outside the scope of the use case. 
It can be any element that can trigger an interaction with the use case. Define the roles that users o 
r other systems play while interacting with the system. 
It is usually individuals involved with the system defined according to their roles. 
The relationship: Communication associations connect actors with the use cases in which they participa 
te. Relationships among use cases are defined by means of including and extending relationships. 
It is a connection between the actors and the use cases. The Include Relationship (<<include>> or <<us 
es>>) represents the inclusion of the functionality of one use case within another. The arrow is drawn 
from the base use case to the used use case. The Extend Relationship (<<extend>>) represents the exte 
nsion of the use case to include optional functionality. 
Use Case: are the specific roles played by the actors within the system 
2.2.1. Actor Specification 
This part describes who the actors are and what their role is in the system. In the proposed system, t 
here are eight actors who are participating. The following are the actors in the proposed system: 
System Administrator: An administrator who interacts with the proposed system and has full control ove 
r the system. After logging in to the system, their responsibilities include:

2.3. Sequence Diagram 
A sequence diagram is a kind of interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another 
and in what order in a system. It shows object interactions arranged in a time sequence. UML sequence 
diagrams model the flow of logic within your system in a visual manner, enabling you to both document 
and validate your logic. They are commonly used for both analysis and design purposes. Sequence diagra 
ms are the most popular UML artifact for dynamic modeling, which focuses on identifying the behavior w 
ithin your system. 
UML Sequence Diagrams Description 
Capture the interaction between objects in the context of a collaboration. 
Show object instances that play the roles defined in a collaboration. 
Show the order of the interaction visually by using the vertical axis of the diagram to represent 
time, what messages are sent, and when. 
Show elements as they interact over time, showing interactions or interactions, for instance.

2.4. Class Diagram 
This class diagram shows the detailed associations and attributes of the proposed system. A class diag 
ram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a type of static structure diagram that describes the st 
ructure of a system by showing the system's classes, 
Objects 
their Attributes 
Operations (methods) 
And the relationships among the classes 
A class diagram is an illustration of the relationships and source code dependencies among classes in 
the Unified Modeling Language (UML). It provides an overview of the target system by describing the ob 
jects and classes within the system and the relationships between them.

Chapter Three 
3. System Design 
System design is the transformation of the analysis model into a system design model. System design is 
the first part to get into the solution domain in software development. This chapter focuses on trans 
forming the analysis model into a design model that takes into account the non-functional requirements 
and constraints described in the problem statement and requirement analysis sections discussed earlie 
r. 
3.1. Design Goal 
The objectives of design are to model the system with high quality. The design goals are derived from 
non-functional requirements, which means a non-functional requirement is the description of the featur 
e characteristics and attributes of the system as well as any constraints that may limit the boundary 
of the proposed solution. 
3.2. System Decomposition 
To reduce the complexity of the solution domain, we decompose a system into simpler parts, called subs 
ystems, which are made of a number of solution domain classes. In the case of complex subsystems, we r 
ecursively apply this principle and decompose a subsystem into a set of loosely dependent parts that m 
ake up the system. Subsystem decomposition is the way that helps us to distinguish the parts of the op 
erations that take place within the organization 
Figure 9. System decomposition 
3.3. System Architecture 
The purpose of design is to show the direction in which the application is being developed and to obta 
in clear and sufficient information needed to derive the actual implementation of the application. The 
work is based on the services provided on the internet to customers. Once the services are available UserForm17 - 13 
based on customer requests, they will be delivered with specific privileges to access, receive, and vi 
sit the site. The architecture used for the system is a client-server architecture where a client can 
use internet browsers to access the web-based crime file management system within the local area netwo 
rk of the agency or anywhere using the internet. It stores this data in a relational database manageme 
nt system. The middle tier (web/application server) implements the business logic, controller logic, a 
nd presentation logic to control the interaction between the application's clients and data. The contr 
oller logic processes client requests, such as requests for reservations and show services provided by 
th 
e printing enterprise system from the database. 
Figure 10. System Architecture 
3.4. Component Diagram 
Component modeling shows which components or objects will be accessed by the user. In this modeling of 
the system's components, it will be shown that there is a relationship among components. 
By this diagram, components of the system will be wired, showing that there is a relationship among co 
mponents: management of the system, database operations performed on databases, and security issues. 
Figure 11. Component diagram 
3.5. State Chart Diagram 
A state chart diagram describes the flow of control of the Samara police station criminal management p 
roposed system from one state to another to describe the system dynamically. States are defined as a c 
ondition in which an object exists and changes when some event is triggered. So the most important pur 
pose of a state chart diagram is to model the life of an object from creation to termination

minalFigure 16. State Chart Diagram for Update ProfileFigure 17. State Chart Diagram for Register Empl 
oyee 
3.6. Deployment Diagram 
A deployment diagram shows the execution architecture of systems that represent the assignment (deploy 
ment) of software artifacts to deployment targets (usually nodes). Nodes represent either hardware dev 
ices or software execution environments. 
Deployment diagrams are used to model the hardware that will be used to implement the system, the link 
between different items of hardware, and the deployment of software on that hardware. 
Through the deployment diagram, we are able to model: 
Where hardware Is located 
Where software Is located 
What the communication path is between various hardware parts 
Deployment Diagram Description: 
Browser: Online viewers will be able to communicate with the web server using a browser. 
Web Server: Using Apache as the web server, it will be responsible for accepting and responding to req 
uests sent by the browsers. 
Database: This will be responsible for storing information on the computer. 
Figure 18. Deployment Diagram 
3.7. Persistence Data Management 
The persistent data model describes the persistent data stored by the system and the data management i 
nfrastructure required for it. This section typically includes the description of data schemas, the se 
lection of a database, and the description of the encapsulation of the database. Here, as the system i 
ncludes a large amount of data received from users and is implemented in large organizations, it needs 
persistent data storage. Therefore, our software system uses a database called SQL Server to manage a 
nd store data persistently. Information related to admin, preventive officer, case, news, feedback, an 
d others is persistent data and is hence stored on a database management system. Moreover, storing dat 
a in a database enables the system to perform complex queries on large data sets. In order to store da 
ta persistently in a database, those class objects identified in the class diagram of CMS are mapped i 
nto tables, and the attributes are mapped into fields for the respective tables. The tables of the sys 
tem 
with their respective fields and the relationships that exist between the tables are expressed in thi 
s portion of the project. 
Figure 19. Persistence data management 
3.8. Access Control and Security 
In these aspects of the system design issues of the Samara police station crime management system, we 
are concerned about two things: protecting the system from external threats and ensuring that the norm 
al day-to-day operation of the system processes data in a controlled manner. Therefore, we are focusinUserForm17 - 14 
g on the design to ensure the secure operation of the information system and safeguard the information 
and assets stored in it so that the Samara police station crime management system runs properly. This 
means that in the design, we are concerned with information security and application controls.

3.9. User Interface 
User interface design is the design of a system with a focus on the user's experience and interaction. 
The main goal of user interface design is to make the user's interaction as simple and efficient as p 
ossible. 
In this system, users would communicate with the system through the following user interface elements: 
links, buttons, forms, and pictures that are described under the system. The following interface desi 
gn describes the logical characteristics of some interfaces between the system and the users.

4. Implementation and Testing 
4.1. Implementation Overview 
Implementation is the execution of any idea, model, or method in information technology. It refers to 
the process of setting up new software and hardware after a purchase is made. Implementation in the sy 
stem includes implementing the attributes and methods of each object and integrating all the objects i 
n the system to function as a single system. The implementation activity spans the gap between the det 
ailed object design model and a complete set of source code files that can be compiled together. 
The objective of the system implementation phase is to convert the final physical system specification 
into working and reliable software and hardware, document the work that has been done, and provide he 
lp for current and future users. 
While we were thinking about developing this web-based application system, we encountered a number of 
constraints, but the following are the most common: 
Lack of fast internet access 
Lack of time 
Lack of resources such as computers, laptops, etc. 
converting a logical design into an application using selected programming languages. To develop this 
project, the team members used the following programming languages: PHP, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. 
PHP is a server-side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to manage dynamic content 
, databases, session tracking, and even to build entire e-commerce sites. 
It is integrated with a number of popular databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Sybase, Info 
rmix, and Microsoft SQL Server. 
4.2. Algorithm Design 
An algorithmic view of a problem gives insight that may make a program simpler to understand and to wr 
ite. Every algorithm needs a process in order to be created and utilized, and they need the four stage 
s of algorithm analysis: design, implement, and experiment.
